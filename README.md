### Overview
In this paper, we proposed a convolutional architecture for the task of handwritten text recognition that utilizes only 1D
convolutions, dense residual connections and a SE module. We also proposed a simple and effective data augmentation
technique-T ACo useful for OCR/HTR tasks. We have presented experimental study on components of Easter2.0
architecture including dense residual connections, normalization choices, SE module, TACo variations and few-shot
training. Our work achieves SOTA results on IAM-Test set when training data is limited, also Easter2.0 has very
small number of trainable parameters compared to other solutions. The proposed architecture can be used in search of
smaller, faster and efficient OCR/HTR solutions when available annotated data is limited.
